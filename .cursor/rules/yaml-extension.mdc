Rule Name: yaml-extension.mdc
Description: 
All YAML files in the project must use the .yml extension instead of .yaml. This includes:
1. Docker Compose files (docker-compose.yml, docker-compose-dev.yml)
2. GitHub Actions workflow files (.github/workflows/*.yml)
3. Kubernetes manifests (k8s/*.yml)
4. Any other YAML configuration files

The .yml extension is the preferred standard in the industry and provides better compatibility with various tools and systems.
