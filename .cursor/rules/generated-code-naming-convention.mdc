Rule Name: generated-code-naming-convention.mdc
Description: 
Generated code should follow these naming conventions:
1. Source files should use snake_case (e.g., queue_service.ts, task_service.ts)
   - Exception: Model files should use PascalCase to match their exported class names (e.g., User.ts, Media.ts)
2. Each package/directory should have an index.ts file that exports all public members
3. Class names and exported members should use camelCase (e.g., queueService, taskService)
4. The index.ts file should import and re-export all public members from the package
5. All imports should use single quotes (e.g., import { x } from './y')

Example:
```
// queue_service.ts
export class QueueService { ... }
export const queueService = new QueueService();

// task_service.ts
export class TaskService { ... }
export const taskService = new TaskService();

// User.ts (model file)
export class User { ... }

// index.ts
import { queueService } from './queue_service';
import { taskService } from './task_service';
import { User } from './User';

export {
  queueService,
  taskService,
  User
};
