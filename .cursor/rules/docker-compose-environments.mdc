Rule Name: docker-compose-environments.mdc
Description: 
The project uses two Docker Compose files:
- docker-compose.yml: Production environment configuration
- docker-compose-dev.yml: Development environment configuration

When helping with Docker-related issues:
1. Always check which environment (production/dev) we're working with
2. For development debugging, use docker-compose-dev.yml
3. For production deployment, use docker-compose.yml
4. The development environment includes additional debugging tools and configurations
5. The production environment is optimized for performance and security
